# (Beta) Adobe Experience Platform Debugger {#adobe-experience-platform-debugger}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Debugger is currently in beta. The documentation and the functionality are subject to change. 

[Adobe Experience Platform Debugger for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adobe-experience-platform/bfnnokhpnncpkdmbokanobigaccjkpob) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adobe-experience-platform-dbg/) examines your web pages and helps you find problems with how your Experience Cloud solutions are implemented.

Use Platform Debugger with the other Adobe activation solutions for a workflow like the following:

1. Use [Launch](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/launch/using/overview.html) or [DTM](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/dtm/using/dtm-home.html) to insert code that activates [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/experience-cloud.html) solutions on your pages. 

1. Use [Adobe Experience Platform Auditor](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/auditor/) to test your implementations. 
1. Use the Adobe Experience Platform Debugger to debug issues found by Auditor or to examine other information about your implementations.

The above steps are not necessarily performed in that order, but it is a common process.

Although you can run Platform Debugger on any web page, any non-public data is only available in the extension if you are authenticated into the Experience Cloud in one of your open Chrome tabs.

## Use cases {#section-9fcd0583ed184943a8f0c2d3c00658e0}

Use Platform Debugger  to gather information that helps you understand how your Experience Cloud solutions are implemented. For example:

* **Adobe Experience Platform Launch:** See which property, environment, build are deployed on a page. 
* **Target:** See which activities you qualify or don't qualify for and why.
